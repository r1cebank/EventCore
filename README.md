### About

EventCore is the example application for next generation event applications

### What's special?

Well everything is special about EventCore, it differs from traditional approach of configurable applications. It uses JSON files to store everything from number of tabs to what data needs to be shown in the app.

#### Use of React Native

Its been a debate what kind of technology we should use for an App tailored for events. React Native offered us a painless way to design modular Apps that can be easily configured while providing us a fast performance due to the native nature of its implementation

#### Designed with users in mind

Powered by the powerful React Native library and designs from Facebook's F8 conference app. EventCore apps are beautiful and fast. We are not only serving the event organizers, but also the users using the app. 

0. Powered by React Native, you get the best of both worlds. You will be able to extend this application and enjoy the performance edge native application has.
1. Incremental updates, many event application require you to download massive database upgrade when organizer changed something in the app. With incremental updates, user only download what is updated.
