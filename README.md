### What's special?

Well everything is special about EventCore, it differs from traditional approach of configurable applications

#### Use of React Native

Its been a debate what kind of technology we should use for an App tailored for events. React Native offered us a painless way to design modular Apps that can be easily configured while providing us a fast performance due to the native nature of its implementation

Powered by the powerful React Native library and designs from Facebook's F8 conference app. EventCore apps are beautiful and fast. We are not only serving the event organizers, but also the users using the app.
